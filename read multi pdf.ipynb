Under the current trend scenario, only 41.2% of the existingwetland would be retained, whereas the potential distribution area of all the mangrove species will decrease\\nby an average of 30%. Under the sustainable development and ecological protection scenarios, the mangrove hab-\\nitat could be increased by 11% to 61%, depending on the species. Different mangrove species showed varied sen-sitivity to the improved land-use policies, with several species being harder to restore than others, even underaggressive protection and restoration policies.

Introduction\\nMangrove ecosystems are distributed along the coasts in tropical\\nand subtropical regions between latitudes of approximately 30° N and\\n30° S ( Giri et al., 2011 ) and provide valuable ecosystem services by\\nsupporting coastal ﬁsheries ( Zhang et al., 2019 ) while yielding commer-\\ncial forest products ( Blasco et al., 1996 ). They also provide coastal pro-\\ntection by regulating ﬂooding, erosion, siltation, and tidal surges\\n(Alongi, 2008 ;Giri et al., 2011 ), while storing and sequestering rela-\\ntively large quantities of carbon ( Sasmito et al., 2019 ). Additionally, mil-\\nlions of coastal residents live around mangrove ecosystems and draw\\nheavily from their goods and services ( Atkinson et al., 2016 ;Gevana\\net al., 2015 ).\\nThe proximity of mangroves to coastal population centers leads to\\nmassive degradation and loss. In the last two decades of the 20th cen-\\ntury, approximately 35% of mangroves disappeared ( Valiela et al.,\\n2001 ), with only 15.2 million hectares of mangroves remaining world-\\nwide ( Spalding et al., 2010 ). Furthermore, mangroves are on the verge\\nof extinction in 26 out of the 120 countries with mangroves ( FAO,\\n2007 ), owing to land use and land cover (LULC) changes from small-\\nscale tree harvesting for ﬁrewood ( Malik et al., 2017 )t oi n d u s t r i a l -\\nscale logging for timber ( Sillanpaa et al., 2017 ) and clear-cutting for\\naquaculture ponds ( Richards and Friess, 2016 ;Thomas et al., 2017 ;Jia\\net al., 2018 ) that replaced mangrove areas worldwide. In addition, man-\\ngrove clearance for urban expansion and development of coastal infra-\\nstructure has added to the losses, particularly in places where coastal\\npopulations are rapidly expanding ( Worthington and Spalding, 2018 ).\\nFor example, a massive loss of mangrove forests, approximately 1.9 mil-\\nlion hectares, has been reported in Asia since 1980 ( Malik et al., 2017 ).\\nIn China, a total of 12,924 ha of mangrove forests have disappeared\\nbetween 1980 and 2000 ( Jia et al., 2018 ). Reclamation was the main\\ncause of mangrove forest loss, with 97.6% being used to build aquacul-\\nture ponds ( Paulson Institute, 2020 ). The increase in urban construction\\nland and decrease in mangrove forests also showed a signi ﬁcant corre-\\nlation ( Tuholskea et al., 2017 ). In recent years, mangrove conservation\\nand restoration efforts in China have faced problems, such as insuf ﬁcient\\neffectiveness and low survival rates ( Peng et al., 2016 ). The reasons for\\nthis include urbanization and reclamation of suitable mangrove habitats\\nand improper site selection of restoration projects ( Fan and Wang,\\n2017 ;Jia et al., 2018 ), with only 57% of the replanted mangroves\\nbeing successfully restored nationwide ( Chen et al., 2009 ). In the Na-\\ntional Action Plan for Mangrove Conservation and Restoration\\n(2020 –2025), the Chinese government planned to restore 18,800 ha\\nof mangroves by 2025 ( MNR and NFGA, 2020 ). Moreover, it is now ac-\\nknowledged that improved mangrove ecosystem management, by\\npreventing further land-use change and promoting regeneration efforts,\\ni.e., restoration, rehabilitation, and afforestation, is fundamental for\\nmangrove conservation ( Peng et al., 2016 ;Jia et al., 2018 ;Sasmito\\net al., 2019 ). Thus, balancing the economic growth needs of land and\\nmangrove habitat conservation/restoration is a signi ﬁcant challenge,\\nand knowledge on the spatial distribution of mangrove habitat changes\\ndriven by land-use pressure, the change rates, and the effect of different\\npolicies can provide an important scienti ﬁc basis for the formulation of\\nmanagement strategies.\\nIdeally, mangroves can be afforested in theoretically suitable areas.\\nHowever, owing to coastal socioeconomic development, not all of\\nthese areas are available for mangrove afforestation, such as urban\\nand aquaculture areas. Several tools can be used to assess this issue.\\nSuitable habitats for mangroves can be mapped using species distribu-\\ntion models (SDMs) ( Johnson et al., 2006 ;Phillips et al., 2017 ). SDMs\\ncan analyze the relationship between species distribution data and en-\\nvironmental factors through statistical algorithms to predict the distri-\\nbution probability of related species ( Kulhanek et al., 2011 ;Li et al.,\\n2019 ), and have been successfully used to map suitable areas of man-\\ngroves ( Charrua et al., 2020 ;Hu et al., 2020a ), with the maximum en-\\ntropy model (MaxEnt) showing the best performance. On the otherhand, land-use change models are often used to simulate land-use dy-\\nnamics and support political decisions on land-use management\\n(Tesfaw et al., 2018 ;Peng et al., 2020 ). Land-use change models can de-\\ntermine where (location of change) and at what rate land-use changes\\nare likely to occur (quantity of change) ( Trisurat et al., 2010 ;\\nSakayarote and Shrestha, 2019 ). However, these two model types are\\nusually used independently, i.e., either considering natural suitability(Charrua et al., 2020 ;Hu et al., 2020b ) or land-use pressures ( Sardar\\nand Samadder, 2021 ), and have seldom been combined to study the\\nspatiotemporal dynamics of mangrove habitats. Coupling SDMs and\\nland-use change models can address how suitable habitats for man-\\ngroves interact with future land-use changes and help make sugges-\\ntions for appropriate land-use and mangrove management policies.\\nTo predict the con ﬂict between mangrove habitat and land use, and\\nexplore how land-use changes will drive the spatiotemporal patterns\\nof mangrove habitats, this study combined an SDM and land-use change\\nmodel focusing on Guangdong Province. Guangdong has the largest\\nmangrove distribution area among China's coastal provinces ( Dan\\net al., 2016 ), and is the most economically developed coastal regions in\\nthe nation, facing huge development pressures. We aimed to (1) develop\\nan integrated framework to assess mangrove habitat dynamics under\\nland-use pressures across space and time; (2) identify suitable afforesta-\\ntion habitats for different mangrove species; (3) simulate land-use and\\nmangrove potential habitat changes until 2030 under three policy sce-\\nnarios; and (4) evaluate the impacts of different land-use policies to pro-\\nvide information for mangrove protection and restoration management.\\n2. Methods2.1. Study area\\nGuangdong Province is located at 20° 13 ′N–25° 31 ′N and 109° 39 ′\\nE\\n−117° 19 ′E, with the Tropic of Cancer running through the province\\n(Liao and Zhang, 2014 ), and its coastline (8500 km) covers the northern\\ntropical and southern subtropical temperature zones. The Gross Domestic\\nProduct (GDP) of Guangdong ranks ﬁrst nationwide with over 115 mil-\\nlion people ( NBSC, 2020 ), and its GDP growth rate was 6.2% in 2019, mak-\\ning it one of the fastest economically growing regions worldwide ( Lv\\net al., 2012 ). According to the Second National Wetland Resources Survey,\\n57.3% of China's mangroves are scattered along the coastline of Guang-\\ndong ( Fig. 1 ), with an area of 12,040 ha ( Dan et al., 2016 ;Yang et al.,\\n2018 ;Wu et al., 2011 ). There are 14 native true mangrove species, with\\nAvicennia marina ,Aegiceras corniculatum ,Sonneratia caseolaris , and\\nKandelia obovata being the most common species ( Yang et al., 2018 ).\\n2.2. Methodology framework\\nAn integrated framework was proposed to identify suitable man-\\ngrove afforestation habitats and predict the impact of future land-usechange on mangrove habitats based on MaxEnt and Dyna-CLUE model-\\ning ( Fig. 2 ). The proposed approach consists of four steps: (1) dataset\\ncollection and processing, including mangrove presence, environmen-\\ntal, LULC, and socioeconomic data; (2) predicting the potential suitabil-\\nity of mangrove distribution by MaxEnt modeling using the presence\\ndata and environmental variables; (3) simulating the 2030 land-use\\nchange under three scenarios through Dyna-CLUE modeling;\\n(4) predicting the spatial change of mangrove habitat under the con-\\nstraints of land-use pattern by deducting all the arti ﬁcial land-use\\ntypes from the theoretically suitable area of mangroves ( Bastin et al.,\\n2019 ;Vessella and Schirone, 2013 ).\\n2.3. MaxEnt modeling2.3.1. Species occurrence records\\nESRI World Imagery 2018 (resolution 2.5 m) was used to visually in-\\nterpret the mangrove forest patches along the coast. The patches inY. Wang, B. Chao, P. Dong et al. Science of the Total Environment 788 (2021) 147914\\n2Zhanjiang, the Pearl River Estuary, and Shantou were then checked\\nthrough on-site investigations in 2018 –2019. Reconnaissance and sam-\\npling surveys were conducted and combined with historical records\\nfrom the literature review ( Chen et al., 2017 ;Li et al., 2016 ;Lin et al.,\\n2006 ) to determine the distribution of mangrove species. Thereafter,\\n196 patches ( Fig. 1 ) were resampled into points using the Fishnetmethod in ArcGIS Pro 2.6.2, with a sampling resolution of 100 m. Finally,\\n7777 occurrence points were obtained to generate the species presence\\ndataset. As these mangroves comprised temperature-limited species\\n(Lin and Fu, 1995 ;Wu et al., 2018 ), we divided the 14 species into\\nseven groups according to their distribution margin and cold tolerance\\n(Table 1 ). According to the occurrence of each group, the sampling\\nFig. 1. Study area and mangrove occurrence records.\\nFig. 2. Methodological framework. SSS, sea surface salinity; SST, sea surface temperature.Y. Wang, B. Chao, P. Dong et al.

Environmental variables\\nTemperature, salinity, substrate, and distance from the coastline are\\nimportant factors affecting the growth and distribution of mangroves\\n(Peng et al., 2016 ). In this study, the original environmental dataset\\ncontained 40 variables related to mangrove distribution, including bio-\\nclimatic, terrain, substrate, sea surface temperature (SST), and sea sur-\\nface salinity (SSS) variables. As strong variable collinearity may cause\\nmisinterpretation of the MaxEnt model owing to the high correlation\\nlevel among variables ( Jayasinghe and Kumara, 2019 ), a correlation\\nanalysis of 40 environmental variables was performed. The variables\\nwith high correlation (Pearson correlation coef ﬁcient |r| ≥0.8) were re-\\nmoved, and the less correlated variables were retained for the MaxEnt\\nmodel ( Chakraborty et al., 2016 ;Wei et al., 2018 ;Jayasinghe and\\nKumara, 2019 ). The resultant variable set contained 20 predictors\\n(Table 2 ). All the environmental variable layers were interpolated into\\nthe coastal area with a 10 km buffer zone along the coastline and stan-\\ndardized into the same 1 km grids. Finally, these layers were converted\\nto ASCII format for further processing in MaxEnt.\\n2.3.3. Model settings and evaluation\\nSuitable habitats for mangroves in Guangdong Province were pre-\\ndicted using MaxEnt 3.4.1 ( Phillips et al., 2017 ). MaxEnt estimates the\\nhabitat suitability of targeted species by ﬁnding the maximum entropy\\nof the species distribution based on input presence data and environ-\\nmental variables ( Phillips et al., 2006 ). In the present study, 75% of the\\npresence data was randomly selected as training data, while the re-\\nmaining 25% was used as testing data. The recommended default pa-\\nrameters for the convergence threshold (10 –5), maximum number of\\niterations (500), maximum number of background points (10,000),\\nand bootstrap resampling method were used. The averaged result\\nfrom 10 replications was taken as the ﬁnal output.\\nModel performance was evaluated based on the area under the\\ncurve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The\\nAUC was used to evaluate the model ef ﬁcacy, with an AUC closer to 1 in-\\ndicating better performance ( Wang et al., 2020a ). The permutation im-\\nportance of the variables was evaluated using the model and\\ndetermined by randomly permuting the values of each variable\\namong the training points and measuring the resulting decrease in the\\ntraining AUC.\\n2.4. Dyna-CLUE model simulation\\n2.4.1. Model process and data\\nThe Dyna-CLUE model can simulate and predict the spatial layout of\\nland use through quantitative analysis and summarization of the inter-\\nactions among different land covers, and natural, policy, and social fac-\\ntors ( Verburg and Overmars, 2009 ). The model includes two parts: anon-spatial demand module for predicting future land use demand\\nand a space allocation module for calculating land use plans. The\\nDyna-CLUE model calculates the distribution probability of a certain\\nLULC type in a certain area through the spatial module. Then multiple it-\\nerations in the non-spatial module are performed according to the ini-\\ntial land use data, land use scenarios, time series, and other\\nparameters, and ﬁnally the land use pattern of the forecast year is calcu-\\nlated and determined through the iteration result ( Peng et al., 2020 ).\\nThe change rate of each LULC type was calculated using LULC data for\\n2015 and 2020 ( http://www.resdc.cn/ ). In the intertidal zone, the distri-\\nbution dataset of the national wetland and coastal aquaculture ponds\\n(http://gre.geodata.cn ) was used to complete the coastal LULC map.\\nThus, the ﬁnal map was reclassi ﬁed into eight LULC types: cultivated\\nland, grassland, woodland, water, wetland, bare land, urban and indus-\\ntrial land, and aquaculture.\\nLand-use changes are related to various biophysical and socioeco-\\nnomic drivers ( Peng et al., 2020 ). Thus, ﬁve topographic and ﬁve socio-\\neconomic indices were input into the model as driving factors ( Table 3 ).\\nConsidering the prediction accuracy and operation limit of the Dyna-\\nCLUE model, all data were resampled to 250 m ( Gong et al., 2018 ).\\n2.4.2. Setting of land-use scenarios\\nThree scenarios were developed for 2030 according to the current\\nland-use change from 2015 to 2020. The current trend scenario (CTS)\\nwas based on the assumption that the tendency of land-use change in\\nthe past ﬁve years was maintained. The sustainable development sce-\\nnario (SDS) considered the maintenance and restoration of natural eco-\\nsystems while promoting urbanization and economic development.\\nAquaculture was the main reason for the destruction of mangroves\\n(Fan and Wang, 2017 ;Paulson Institute, 2020 ), and due to unsustain-\\nable aquaculture development, approximately 30% of aquaculture\\nponds are currently abandoned and unused ( Paulson Institute, 2020 ).\\nBased on these data, in SDS, the change rate of arti ﬁcial land types was\\nassumed to be reduced by 50%, whereas 50% of the aquaculture area lo-\\ncated at 0 –6 m water depth would be restored to wetland. The ecolog-\\nical protection scenario (EPS) considered aggressive ecological\\nprotection and restoration policy, completely stopping the transfer\\nfrom natural to arti ﬁcial land types. In this scenario, the urban and in-\\ndustrial land was assumed to stop expanding. The decreasing trend of\\nnatural land types was assumed to be reversed, the increasing trend\\nwould be half of the historical decreasing rate. Moreover, 100% of the\\naquaculture area located at a water depth of 0 –6 m would be restored\\nto wetlands. The spatial land-use changes of these scenarios were sim-\\nulated with the Dyna-CLUE model (version 2.0) ( Verburg et al., 2002 ;\\nOvermars et al., 2007 ) based on the 10 driving factors.\\n2.4.3. Model evaluation\\nTheﬁtness of driving factors and land conversion were tested using\\nthe ROC method ( Swets, 1988 ;Pontius et al., 2008 ).

If the two phases of land-use type maps are identical, the kappa\\nvalue is 1, whereas if the kappa value is less than 0.4, the simulation ef-\\nfect is considered poor ( Liao et al., 2019 ).\\n2.5. Habitat change calculation\\nFirst, for each species group, a binary map was generated based on\\nhabitat suitability, with a suitability threshold of 0.5 ( Wang et al.,\\n2020b ). Grids with a value of 1 indicated that the area was a potential\\nhabitat for mangroves, meanwhile grids with a value of 0 were consid-\\nered to have inadequate environmental conditions for mangrove\\ngrowth. Then, the arti ﬁcial land types (cultivated land, urban and indus-\\ntrial land, and aquaculture) in current and future scenarios were\\nregarded as areas that were not available for afforestation and were ex-\\ncluded from the binary maps. The potential restorable habitats wereﬁnally identi ﬁed by deducting the arti ﬁcial lands and unsuitable habi-\\ntats, and the changes in trends were analyzed based on these results.\\n3. Results\\n3.1. Theoretical distribution of mangrove habitats\\nIn the MaxEnt modeling, the averaged AUC values of the seven spe-\\ncies groups were between 0.89 and 0.99, indicating that the model per-\\nformed well in identifying the mangrove habitat distribution.\\nFurthermore, the potential distribution ranges varied signi ﬁcantly\\namong groups. G1 and G6 had the widest and narrowest distribution,\\nwith an area of 160,513 and 9663 ha, respectively. Stacking the distribu-\\ntions of all groups, species richness decreased with increasing latitude\\n(Fig. 3 ), and the predicted suitable range for most mangrove species\\nwas between 20.5° N and 22.5° N.\\nBy analyzing the environmental variable permutation importance,\\nwe found that the importance of environmental drivers also varied\\namong groups. Nevertheless, variables from types of precipitation, sa-\\nlinity, and sea surface temperature mostly determined the distribution\\nof mangroves in Guangdong Province. We screened and listed the top\\nthree important variables for each group in Table 4 . The annual precip-\\nitation, SST in the coldest season, and salinity range showed important\\ncontributions in most groups. These environmental variables were\\nused to describe the multidimensional niche of each group ( Fig. 4 ),\\nand indicated that the niches for G1 and G4 were wider than those of\\nother groups, whereas the niches for G6 and G7 were the narrowest,Table 2\\nList of environment variables used in MaxEnt modeling.\\nData types Environmental variables Units Data sources\\nBioclimatic Annual mean temperature °C WorldClim version 2.1 ( www.worldclim.org )\\nMean diurnal range °CIsothermality %Range of annual temperature variation °C\\nMean temperature of wettest quarter °C\\nAnnual precipitation mmPrecipitation seasonality %Precipitation of warmest quarter mmPrecipitation of coldest quarter mm\\nTopographic Euclidean distance to the coast M The Paci ﬁc Islands Ocean Observing System's Distance to Nearest Coastline ( http://oos.soest.\\nhawaii.edu/thredds/ncss/dist2coast_1deg_ocean/dataset.html )\\nCompound Topographic Index – Calculated by ArcGIS Pro 2.6.2 according to elevation data\\nElevation – ETOPO1 bathymetry data from NOAA https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/global.html\\nLocal deviation from global – Calculated by ArcGIS Pro 2.6.2 according to elevation data\\nSubstrate Substrate type – 2018 AHO S57 map\\nSea surface salinity (SSS) Annual SSS mean ‰ Bio-ORACLE dataset\\n(www.bio-oracle.org )\\nAnnual SSS range ‰\\nSea surface temperature (SST) Mean SST of coldest quarter °C Derived from NASA MODIS-Aqua Level-3( http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov )\\nMonthly SST range\\nAnnual SST mean\\nAnnual SST range\\nTable 3Driving factors used in Dyna-CLUE modeling.\\nData types Driving factors Units Data sources\\nTopographic Elevation m National Catalogue Service for Geographic Information ( http://mulu.tianditu.gov.cn/ )\\nSlope °Aspect –\\nSoil erosion – Resource and Environment Science and Data Center ( http://www.resdc.cn/ )\\nSoil texture –\\nSocioeconomic Distance to rivers m National Catalogue Service for Geographic Information ( http://mulu.tianditu.gov.cn/ )\\nDistance to roads mDistance to settlements mGDP Yuan km\\n2y−1Resource and Environment Science and Data Center ( http://www.resdc.cn/ )\\nPopulation Person km−2y−1Y.

Under CTS, aquaculture and\\nurban/industrial land were the main net in ﬂow land types, and the nat-\\nural land types were mainly out ﬂow. However, under the alternative\\nland-use policies, land-use transfer patterns showed great changes.For example, under SDS, the urbanization process would take up a\\nlarge amount of cultivated land, whereas cultivated land and aquacul-\\ntural areas would be returned to natural land types. Under EPS, a large\\nnumber of aquacultural areas would be restored to wetlands, whereas\\nthe cultivated areas would be returned to grassland, woodland, and\\nwater ( Fig. 5 ).\\nCurrently, the scattered mangrove patches are mainly distributed as\\nwetlands, water, and woodland. Under CTS, these land-use types were\\nall reduced, especially the wetland, with a decline so fast that, at this\\nrate, only 41.2% of the existing wetlands would remain by 2030\\n(Table 6 ). Under SDS, the woodland and water areas were maintained\\nat the level they were in 2020, and the area of wetland increased signif-\\nicantly. Meanwhile, under EPS, woodland and water areas were re-\\nstored to those of 2015, and the wetland area was restored to over\\nthree times that in 2015 ( Fig. 6 ).\\nFig. 3.

The impacts of land-use change on mangrove habitats\\nThe suitable areas estimated using MaxEnt described the environ-\\nmental limits for the presence of mangrove species. Next, the current\\nand future anthropogenic factors (urbanization, restoration, etc.) were\\nimposed onto the theoretically suitable areas to predict the actual affor-\\nestation extent of mangrove forests ( Table 7 ). All arti ﬁcial land types\\n(cultivated land, urban and industrial land, and aquaculture) were\\ndeducted from the theoretically suitable mangrove areas, with G1 and\\nG6 showing the largest and smallest distribution range, respectively,\\nunder all current and future scenarios. Driven by the simulated land-\\nuse pattern in 2030, the actual available habitat ranges of all groups\\nwere predicted to decline signi ﬁcantly under CTS, with an obvious frag-\\nmentation of the mangrove forest patches. In contrast, the mangrove\\ndistribution range increased signi ﬁcantly under SDS and EPS, maintain-\\ning and promoting the integrity of habitat patches ( Fig. 7 ).According to the results, if the current land-use policy is maintained\\nuntil 2030, the potential distribution area of all mangrove species will\\ndecrease by an average of approximately 30%. However, under the\\nother two scenarios, different mangrove species showed varied sensi-\\ntivity to conservation and restoration policies. The mangrove distribu-\\ntion area could be increased by 11% –61% depending on the different\\nscenarios and species groups. Among all groups, G6 showed the least\\noptimistic scenario, with dif ﬁculties to achieve effective growth even\\nunder aggressive protection and restoration scenarios ( Fig. 8 ).\\n4. Discussion\\n4.1. Mangrove conservation and restoration implications\\nOur study estimated the potential suitable habitat of 14 mangrove\\nspecies in the Guangdong Province. According to the Red List of Threat-\\nened Species of China, A. speciosum andA. ebracteatus in G6 are classi ﬁed\\nas endangered, whereas B. sexangula andS. caseolaris in G6 and G7, re-\\nspectively, are classi ﬁed as near-threatened ( Wang et al., 2020b ).\\nThese two groups also showed the narrowest distribution ranges and\\necological niches according to the modeled results, which may be re-\\nlated to physiological characteristics ( Chen et al., 2010 ). For example,\\nA. ebracteatus has a poor tolerance to water and strong light, and only\\ngrows in the inner edge of mangrove forests, with a restricted distribu-\\ntion, mostly in the upper intertidal zones ( Huang et al., 2020 ). Mean-\\nwhile, their limited environmental adaptability makes them more\\nsusceptible to external pressures, accelerating their degradation. For in-\\nstance, aquaculture development was the most important reason for\\nthe loss of A. speciosum ,B. sexangula, and S. caseolaris in their original\\ndistribution sites in the 1990s ( Mao, 2011 ). Therefore, we recommend\\nthat these species should be protected as a priority, not only by\\nFig. 4.

In contrast, G6 and G7\\nspecies were distributed in a narrow niche and only suitable for\\nthe southernmost part of the study area. Latitude limitation suggests\\nthat owing to tolerance to low temperatures, the success rate of res-\\ntoration may be reduced by transplanting species in G6 northward.\\nIn the Pearl River Estuary, most of the introduced species of G6\\ndied after the extremely cold winter of 2008, whereas the\\nnative species K. obovata ,A. corniculatum ,a n d A. marina (G1) sur-\\nvived ( Chen et al., 2012 ). In Shantou, after yea rs of afforestation\\npractice, most of the existing mangrove species belong to G1\\n(Peng et al., 2015 ).\\nFurthermore, our results support site selection for mangrove conser-\\nvation and restoration. Areas with the richest mangrove species, such as\\neast Zhanjiang and Yangjiang, where 12 species could coexist, should be\\nconsidered a conservation priority to improve the effectiveness of pro-\\ntection. In addition, the MaxEnt model errors of commission,\\ni.e., regions with high habitat suitability where the species is not cur-\\nrently present, can be considered as candidate sites for mangrove resto-\\nration ( Bittner et al., 2020 ).Table 6\\nAreas of land use and land cover types in 2015, 2020, and three scenarios of 2030 (ha).\\nLand-use type 2015 2020 2030\\nCTS SDS EPS\\nCultivated land 920,856 896,788 836,770 850,521 836,770\\nGrassland 118,625 121,869 126,756 122,046 139,392\\nWoodland 907,063 892,319 849,866 893,616 907,025\\nWater 240,756 221,919 185,147 222,241 240,518\\nWetland 41,206 26,938 11,099 86,784 146,631\\nBare land 10,694 10,175 9056 10,190 19,363\\nUrban and industrial land 384,375 424,425 510,971 468,880 424,425Aquaculture 247,125 276,269 341,035 216,422 156,575\\nTotal 2, 870,700 2,870,700 2,870, 700 2,870,700 2,870,700\\nFig. 6.

Drivers of mangrove habitat change and the effect of land-use policies\\nSimulation of land-use from 2020 to 2030 under the three scenarios\\ndemonstrated that land-use change was the crucial driver of mangrove\\nhabitat shrinkage. Under CTS, the continuous expansion of aquaculture,\\nas well as urban and industrial land, led to a signi ﬁcant decrease in man-\\ngrove habitat. We found that the existing mangrove patches are close tothe edge of aquaculture ponds and thus easily affected by aquaculture\\nactivities, resulting in habitat degradation or direct occupation by aqua-\\nculture activities.

Science of the Total Environment 788 (2021) 147914\\n9mangroves in Hainan Province showed that the aquaculture area in-\\ncreased in 1966 –2009, resulting in mangrove fragmentation and reduc-\\ntion ( Herbeck et al., 2020 ). In addition, uncontrolled urban expansion is\\nthe most important threat for mangroves in developing countries and\\nregions. Urbanization has destroyed more than 30% of the Brazilian\\nsoutheast mangrove forests ( Moschetto et al., 2020 ). In Honduras,\\n19.1% of mangroves have been converted to urban areas since 1985(Tuholskea et al., 2017 ). In Guangdong Province, there was a correlation\\nbetween the increase in urban regions and the loss of mangrove forests,\\nwhich became more apparent with time ( Ai et al., 2020 ). Furthermore,\\nland-use change not only directly affects the coastal estuarine area,\\nbut also disturbs total direct runoff regimes, shifts upstream catchment\\nareas, and affects freshwater inputs to mangroves ( Bhattachan et al.,\\n2018 ;Feng et al., 2020 ;Maﬁ-Gholami et al., 2020b ).\\nIn this study, land-use changes not only caused suitable habitats for\\nmangroves to be occupied, but also affected the protection of man-\\ngroves. Under CTS, mangrove patches not only showed fragmentation,\\nbut also tended to retreat seawards because of the expansion of arti ﬁcial\\nland. Therefore, the construction of mangrove nature reserves faces a di-\\nlemma to a certain extent. Although the government planned to in-\\ncrease the protection rate of mangrove habitats by setting or\\nexpanding nature reserves, it has been dif ﬁcult to extend the reserves\\nto arti ﬁcial land. In Guangdong Province, although the mangrove con-\\nservation rate of mangrove nature reserves increased from the 1980s\\nto the 2010s, most mangroves have been isolated by aquaculture\\nponds and buildings from terrestrial habitats ( Peng et al., 2016 ). There-\\nfore, nature reserves had no choice but to extend their boundaries to\\nlow intertidal zones where mangroves were virtually impossible to\\ngrow. This reduced the actual protection rate of suitable mangrove hab-\\nitats after 2000 ( Peng et al., 2016 ). Hence, owing to the in ﬂuence of\\nland-use patterns, there may even be a loss of mangrove habitat under\\nthe virtual increase in nature reserves.\\nOur results also demonstrated that changes in land-use policies can\\nsigniﬁcantly enhance the potential mangrove survival space. Even if the\\nmost radical protection and restoration strategy (EPS) is not adopted,\\nthe mangrove habitat degradation trend under SDS could be decreased\\nsubstantially or even reversed. Therefore, based on scienti ﬁc demon-\\nstration and after the inquiry of stakeholders, feasible land-use policies\\nshould be put forward to promote the restoration of mangroves. Possi-\\nble resistance may come from stakeholders like aquaculture owners.The success rate of coastal ﬁshpond farming in southern China is only\\nabout 35%, and 30% of aquaculture ponds are currently abandoned\\n(Paulson Institute, 2020 ). Thus, it would be possible to return some\\naquacultural land to wetland, including abandoned aquaculture ponds\\nand some of the ponds that cause the most serious disturbance to man-\\ngroves, to minimize the impact on the livelihood of local communities.\\nAppropriate ecological compensation also should be considered in\\nlocal mangrove conservation and restoration action plans. Moreover,\\nour prediction results indicated that the G6 species were the least sen-\\nsitive to the improved land-use policies. Thus, further conservation\\nstrategies are recommended to maintain and recover this group in addi-\\ntion to land-use policies.\\n4.3. Study uncertainty and improvement\\nPrevious studies on mangrove distribution used a single SDM to ex-\\nplain the in ﬂuence of natural environmental factors on current man-\\ngrove distribution ( Charrua et al., 2020 ;Hu et al., 2020a ), with climate\\nchange, storms, and erosion being used as driving factors by several dy-\\nnamic studies to evaluate past, or predict future, changes in mangrove\\ndistribution (\\nMaﬁ-Gholami et al., 2020a ;Cameron et al., 2021 ;Thakur\\net al., 2021 ). However, land use often plays a direct role in the change\\nin mangrove distribution. A study spanning 35 years showed that the\\nzones accessible to human activities are affected by land cover changes\\nsigniﬁcantly more than by natural drivers ( Quader et al., 2017 ).Hu et al.\\n(2020b) overlaid land-use patterns in mangrove-suitable areas to assessthe current restoration potential. However, few studies have applied the\\nquantitative prediction of land-use change with the simulation of man-\\ngrove distribution change in the future. This study proved that MaxEnt\\nand Dyna-CLUE models can be successfully coupled to ﬁnd available\\nmangrove habitats under different land-use policies. In addition to sta-\\ntistical veri ﬁcation, the modeled result was compared with the results of\\na traditional forestry ﬁeld survey as another kind of model validation. In\\nthe current scenario, the maximum potential habitat was estimated to\\nbe 34,531 ha, which is close to the 32,326 ha obtained through the for-\\nestry surveys ( He et al., 2006 ).\\nAlthough the method was effective, some improvements can still be\\nmade in future studies. For example, the availability of data limited the\\noperating resolution of the MaxEnt model. The deductive method was\\nused to couple the two models ( Bastin et al., 2019 ;Vessella and\\nSchirone, 2013 ) because the dataset resolution of the MaxEnt model\\nwas 1 km (the best resolution available in the World Bioclimatic Data-\\nbase), whereas the resolution of the land-use data was 250 m. There-\\nfore, the two models had to be trained separately at different\\nresolutions. This may have caused the mangrove habitat extent to be\\nover-estimated because the Maxent model could not identify environ-\\nmental heterogeneity within 1 km. The use of the deductive method\\nwith higher-resolution land use data could constrain the habitat extent\\nand compensate for this shortcoming to some extent. If the resolution of\\nmarine environmental data can be improved to match that of LULC data,\\nbetter model coupling pathways could be adopted. For instance, LULC\\ndata could be treated as one of the environmental variables in the\\nMaxEnt model and used directly as input drivers ( Wang et al., 2020a ).\\nIn this study, land-use patterns were adopted as crucial drivers to\\npredict the future changes of mangrove habitats. However, the actual\\nmangrove distribution can also be affected by other factors. The expan-\\nsion of mangrove forests takes at least ﬁve to seven years due to the af-\\nforestation cycle and survival rate ( Wodehouse and Rayment, 2019 ).\\nLong-term survivorship and stable mangrove stands may require\\nmore than 10 years ( Salmo et al., 2013 ;Azman et al., 2021 ). Hence, al-\\nthough the impact of land-use changes on mangrove potential habitats\\nhas been clearly revealed, actual changes in mangrove distribution may\\ntake a long time to manifest. In addition, this study only focused on the\\nspatial pattern change, whereas mangrove degradation drivers such as\\npollution, excavation, and cultivation within the mangrove forest were\\nnot fully considered.\\n5. Conclusion\\nPredicting the spatial extent of mangrove habitats under land-use\\npressure is one of the main challenges for mangrove restoration plan-\\nning and management. Mangrove forest distribution is not only related\\nto environmental conditions but is also affected by land development,\\nsuch as urbanization, cultivation, and aquaculture. Coupling SDM and\\nland-use change models, we proposed an integrated framework to as-\\nsess spatiotemporal changes in mangrove habitats. The land-use driving\\neffects on different mangrove species were also analyzed and compared\\nbased on the MaxEnt model and Dyna-CLUE model in Guangdong,\\nChina. Among three land-use scenarios, keeping the policy as CTS will\\ndecrease mangrove species by approximately 30%. Meanwhile, man-\\ngrove distribution areas could be increased by 11% –61% under SDS\\nand EPS, and the fragmentation of scattered habitat patches could also\\nbe improved. Detailed mangrove habitat distribution characteristics\\ncan be used to guide habitat restoration practices for each group. For ex-\\nample, species in G6, which were listed as endangered or near-\\nthreatened species, had dif ﬁculty achieving effective growth even\\nunder aggressive protection and restoration land-use scenarios, indicat-\\ning that additional conservation efforts should be made for these spe-\\ncies. The coupled use of MaxEnt and Dyna-CLUE models proved\\ncomplementary, offering insights into spatially explicit outcomes, and\\ncould quantify the impacts of different land-use policies on these\\noutcomes.Y.
